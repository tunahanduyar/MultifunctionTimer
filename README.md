This code is a bit complicated, there are a lot of files to create. If you want me to help ig: @tunahanduyar

adbutonusaniyesi : How many seconds will the timer last

int score: We check our game score and activate the ad button.

 AudioSource timer: In the last seconds we can play a sound to add excitement to the game.

The logic is very simple. If we have enough points and the timer expires, a button is activated and we can add +time. A great way to show ads to the user.
